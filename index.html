										Currently working on a solution that doesn't require me to pay to access my own funds. See more on <a href="www.lastbit.io">lastbit</a>. 2018 was easily one of the best years, purely with regards to learning. The sheer amount that I've learned over this last year makes my time as a bachelors student pale in comparison. I'm currently with lastbit in Riga, Latvia. 
										I moved back to India after leaving ETH last December (I was previously a masters student at ETH Zurich) to work full time on lastbit. 
										Finally realized that startups are what I'm going to be doing for the next 10 years atleast.
										</p>
										<p>I created this site with the aim of putting up my latest work and other interesting technology related stuff. I'll try to keep it as updated as possible.</p>

										<p>After some scrutinizing, I've made the decision to pursue a Masters in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, starting September 2016. When I'm not hacking on things or fooling around with sensors and electronics, I spend a vast majority of my time practicing drums. You can watch some of my videos on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shadow12348/videos"><u>channel</u></a></font>. It might not be your cup of tea [Most of my tech. and non-tech. interests are unorthodox in that sense], but if you like it, subscribe! I've also been playing basketball for almost 8 years now. Though at this point in time I haven't found the time to practice as often as I used to, I make sure that I divide my days such that I can keep fit and continue innovating.<p>
											<p>At the moment, I'm working at the L3S Research Center in Germany (Read more about my work here, over <a href='interests.html'><u>here</u></a>). Apart from this, I am fabricating a first of its kind guitar pedal that uses a tube pre-amplifier and a solid-state pre-amplifier that the guitarist has the option of choosing, from his smartphone, followed by a programmable multi-effect guitar pedal. To non-guitar enthusiasts this sounds like a lot of jargon, but if you know what I'm talking about, you would know how interesting this stuff is!<p>
												<p>I'm also the new drummer for the band "Casus" from Hildesheim, Germany! It's been a dream to be in a touring band and play music at a semi-professional level, while managing my Computer Science interests simultaneously and I think I'm getting closer to that goal! Here is an article about me and the band in the<a href="http://www.twilight-magazin.de/3297-hildesheimes-brutal-deather-casus-wieder-komplett.html"><u> Twilight Magazine</u></a>! 
													<p>Another interview with the band, published recently here - <a href="http://www.twilight-magazin.de/interviews/item/hilesheimer-brutal-death-nach-balkan-art-casus-im-interview-april-2016.html"><u> Twilight Magazine</u></a>!</p>
